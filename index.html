<p><h3><p style="color: palevioletred">Breed Summary:</p></h3></p>
<p>The Silken Windhound is a newer breed. Very affectionate to their human companions, they take well to early socialisation training and can easily adapt to all types of lifestyle. This breed can happily live in an apartment as long as they can go for a long walk and have a run about each day. Due to their high prey drive, like other sighthounds, they need strong and secure fencing to keep them in your yard since they can often be tempted to <b title="Proper training and socialization can help with this">chase small animals</b>. The Silken Windhound may be trained for dog sports, agility and obedience, and they’ll appreciate the mental and physical challenge that such training provides. When not properly challenged, they could develop destructive behaviours through boredom. These dogs usually have the occasional high energy burst, but then they’ll happily spend the rest of their time curled up on a sofa with their beloved human family. <i>To learn more about this breed, please visit <a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/silken-windhound#/slide/1">Dogtime.com</a></i></p>

<p><h3><p style="color: forestgreen">Breed Summary:</p></h3></p>
<p>IGs are Greyhounds in miniature—more slender, but a Greyhound’s equal in grace and elegance. Standing ideally 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder, they present the sleek, curving lines common to all coursing hounds. Distinguishing features are the long, fine-boned legs. IGs combine the attentiveness of lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored. They are, though, true sighthounds and will bolt after quick-moving prey at the drop of a cat. A short-coat, low-fat breed, IGs require <b title="Sweaters, Shoes, Coverups">extra care</b> in cold weather.<i> To learn more about this breed, please visit the official <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/italian-greyhound/">American Kennel Club</a> web page.</i></p>
